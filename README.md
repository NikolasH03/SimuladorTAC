# VR TAC Simulator 

> A medical training simulation for mobile VR where players perform a CT scan (TAC) procedure, configure scan parameters, and interpret results through a follow-up questionnaire.

---

## Features 
- **Patient positioning:** Place the patient on the CT machine in the correct position.
- **Parameter configuration:** Set scan values using a virtual computer.
- **Result evaluation:** Complete a questionnaire based on the scan outcome.
- **Platform:** Android Mobile VR.

## My Contribution 
- Core programming and feature integration.
- Implemented gameplay logic for patient positioning, scan parameter handling, and questionnaire flow.
- Integrated existing 3D models and UI elements created by the design team.
